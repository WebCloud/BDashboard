{"name":"Bdashboard","body":"#BDashboard - A basic and clean, yet functional, dashboard made with twitter bootstrap\r\n\r\n##Overview\r\nA super simple, yet amazing to use, dashboard, based on [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)! This dashboard was originally designed and coded to a internal project that worked, and I decided to open source it. So you can use it as you want, and change it as you need. But you must notice that:\r\n\r\n1. This is the __explorer__ version, what does his means? It means that so far it lacks on a more extensive documentation but the code is there to be explored, used, changed and so on!\r\n2. This was made to some specific need, but it can be easily extended. \r\n3. It's using some hardcoded styles for the widgets to work on different screen resolutions, it's actually a todo to fix that and put some percent based sizes.\r\n4. This was a initial prototype and concept to define the interface. So it may very much likely have some bugs, be aware!\r\n5. Use it as you want, the only thing I ask is to reference it back anywhere if possible.\r\n\r\nNow that you read that, [see a demo](http://webcloud.github.com/BDashboard/dashboard.html)\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I may say is \"Sorry for the mess (!)\". I had no time to clean all things, and I just wanted to release the css and js ASAP.\r\n\r\n##Future\r\nI'm working on a version of this dashboard using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), so I plan to release a open source AngularJS version of this dashboard with more interesting concepts. Stay tuned!","tagline":"A basic and clean, yet functional, dashboard made with twitter bootstrap","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
