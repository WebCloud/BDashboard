<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A super simple, yet amazing to use, dashboard, based on <a href="twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>! This dashboard was originally designed and coded to a internal project that worked, and I decided to open source it. So you can use it as you want, and change it as you need. But you must notice that:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the <strong>explorer</strong> version, what does his means? It means that so far it lacks on a more extensive documentation but the code is there to be explored, used, changed and so on!</li>
<li>This was made to some specific need, but it can be easily extended. </li>
<li>It's using some hardcoded styles for the widgets to work on different screen resolutions, it's actually a todo to fix that and put some percent based sizes.</li>
<li>This was a initial prototype and concept to define the interface. So it may very much likely have some bugs, be aware!</li>
<li>Use it as you want, the only thing I ask is to reference it back anywhere if possible.</li>
</ol><p>Now that you read that, <a href="http://webcloud.github.com/BDashboard/dashboard.html">see a demo</a></p>

<p>Another thing that I may say is "Sorry for the mess (!)". I had no time to clean all things, and I just wanted to release the css and js ASAP.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>I'm working on a version of this dashboard using <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, so I plan to release a open source AngularJS version of this dashboard with more interesting concepts. Stay tuned!</p>
